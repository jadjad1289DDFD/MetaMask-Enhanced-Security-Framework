# Overview  
This module demonstrates the critical security checkpoints and potential vulnerabilities in a cryptocurrency wallet’s lifecycle - from password input to wallet locking. Each stage represents a security boundary that requires careful consideration and robust protection mechanisms.  

# Security Flow Diagram  

1. **[USER PASSWORD INPUT]**  
   - Keyloggers can capture keystrokes  
   - Clipboard monitoring possible  
   - Hardware keyloggers effective  

   ↓  

2. **[STANDARD STORAGE]**  
   - Path predictability enables targeting  
   - System malware access  
   - File system attacks  
   - Backup/Shadow copy exposure  

   ↓  

3. **[DECRYPTION PROCESS]**  
   - Memory dump attacks  
   - Process inspection  
   - Debug hooks  
   - Runtime analysis  

   ↓  

4. **[CHROME MEMORY/RAM]**  
   - Memory scanning  
   - Process dumps  

   ↓  

5. **[WALLET UNLOCKED]**  
   - Screen capture of private keys  
   - Memory inspection  
   - Transaction interception  
   - RPC manipulation  

   ↓  

6. **[WALLET LOCKED]**  
   - Memory residue analysis
